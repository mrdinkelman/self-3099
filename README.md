Hello, this is short info about SELF-3099 Import task.
First of all, please look at [original technical task]: <https://github.com/mrdinkelman/self-3099/blob/master/vagrant/task/stock.csv>

For implementation I use external lib **ddeboer/data-import** 
In this task used basical functionality of 'data-import' but with some improvements and tweaks. 
Details and general info available at [project github]: <https://github.com/ddeboer/data-import>

This test solution use Symfony 2.8, PHP 5.6+ and command line for calling and delivering import results.
